# Dilbert
 A Python library for fetching the URL of Dilbert comic strips in different ways.
## Usage
 See the [example](https://github.com/DilbertTech/Dilbert.py/blob/master/dilbert/Example.py) to see how to use this library.
## Why?
 I like Dilbert. This is a base framework for some chatbots I am building in the future. Those will be open sourced under this same organization, which answers your question about "Why an organization?"
