# Dilbert
 A Python library for fetching the URL of Dilbert comic strips in different ways.
## Usage
 It's simple:
 `dilbert_from_date(dateToFetch)`
 Fetches the Dilbert from a specific date.
 `dateToFetch` is a `datetime` object.

  `dilbert_days_ago(fromDaysAgo)`
  Fetches the Dilbert from `fromDaysAgo` amount of days ago.
  `fromDaysAgo` is a number

  `dilbert_days_ago(fromDaysAgo)`
  Fetches the Dilbert from `fromDaysAgo` amount of days ago.
  `fromDaysAgo` is a number

  `dilbert_random()`
  Returns a random Dilbert

  All of these functions return a URL that points to the image source of the comic strip.

  For examples, see the [examples](https://github.com/DilbertTech/Dilbert.py/blob/master/dilbert/Example.py).

## Why?
 I like Dilbert. This is a base framework for some chatbots I am building in the future. Those will be open sourced under this same organization, which answers your question about "Why an organization?"
